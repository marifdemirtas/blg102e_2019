# blg102e_2019
Codes I wrote in class for the lab of BLG102E - Introduction to Scientific&amp;Engineering Computing, our C intro course at ITU, semester of Spring 2019. 

Codes may need changes in order to work properly, since they have been wrote to experiment in the C language and are **not finalized**.
